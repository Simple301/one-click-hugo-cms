      Welcome to the world of Emulation. As a beginner, you should start with Emulating DS/Gameboy games. They are the easiest to Emulate and will take you about 10 minutes to set everything up! You would own a couple of these if you were around here in the 2000s but there is always the illegal way of getting some ROMs.

    It will be more complicated to extract the files legally, but thankfully there is always a video on youtube that can go step by step in explaining you how to extract files onto your PC. Here is a good video explaining what you should do if you own a Nintendo DS/DS Lite: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZk_pH4pjfM.
      If you think that you already know how to do it, we would still recommend you to use FileZilla and Digiex for transfering the data.

      If you don't own a nintendo DS/Gameboy, there is still an illegal way for you to get some ROMs. We would not recommend you to do this, however, there is always a way.
      You can just search up FREE NINTENDO DS ROMs and try what pops up, however, many sites might have malware. I noticed that this site where I get my emulators from: https://www.emulatorgames.net/emulators/, has a ton of ROMs. However if they catch you getting these ROMs there will be consequences.

    The best/safest DS emulator out there is without a doubt DeSuMe. Other emulators are or too complicated or really safe.
    For the Gameboy its the mGBA Emulator. Its really easy to use and its small enough to run on a really old PC.
